# Drug Use 
## Intro 

This is a project with data gathered from the fivethirtyeight repo. It will focus on showing drug use amoung different age groups. I will be focusing in on alcohol, marijuanna, cocaine and heroin use. I need another data project and this data appealed to me. I also need more work with bar charts-which is how I think I will display the data. Link to the repo is the following: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/drug-use-by-age/drug-use-by-age.csv
